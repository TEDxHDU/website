#### 什么是 TED？
> TED 是一个致力于传播有价值思想的非营利性组织。三十年前在加利福尼亚州作为一个四天的会议开始，如今 TED 已经成长为一个用多项倡议支持自己使命的组织。两年度的 TED 会议会邀请世界上前沿的思考者和实干者进行十八分钟的演讲。许多这样的 Talk 之后可以在 TED.com 上免费获取。年度 TED 会议会于每年春天在加拿大不列颠哥伦比亚省的温哥华举行。TED 媒体倡议包括日常发布最新 TED 演讲的 TED.com、提供字幕和互动性抄本以及来自全世界志愿者的翻译的开放翻译项目、教育倡议 TEDEd。TED 设立年度 TED 奖，使拥有改变世界愿望的独特个体得到帮助，让他们的愿望转变成实际行动，总而言之，这个组织相信观念的力量可以改变态度，改变生活，最终一点点的影响世界。

#### 什么是 TEDx？
> 本着传播有价值思想的精神，TEDx 是一个针对当地的、自发组织的活动，给聚在一起的人们分享一种与 TED 相类似的经历，在一场 TEDx 活动中，TED Talk 录像和现场的讲者联合在一起摩擦运行出深刻的讨论和联系。这些当地的自发组织的活动被打上了 TEDx 烙印，x 相当于独立的自发性 TED 活动。TED 会议为 TEDx 项目提供总体的指导，但是独立的 TEDx 项目是自发组织的。

#### About TEDx, x = independently organized event

> In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TED Talks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized. (Subject to certain rules and regulations.)

#### About TED
> TED is a nonprofit organization devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. Started as a four-day conference in California 30 years ago, TED has grown to support its mission with multiple initiatives. The two annual TED Conferences invite the world's leading thinkers and doers to speak for 18 minutes or less. Many of these talks are then made available, free, at TED.com. TED speakers have included Bill Gates, Jane Goodall, Elizabeth Gilbert, Sir Richard Branson, Nandan Nilekani, Philippe Starck, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Sal Khan and Daniel Kahneman.

> The annual TED Conference takes place each spring in Vancouver, British Columbia. TED's media initiatives include TED.com, where new TED Talks are posted daily; the Open Translation Project, which provides subtitles and interactive transcripts as well as translations from volunteers worldwide; the educational initiative TED-Ed. TED has established the annual TED Prize, where exceptional individuals with a wish to change the world get help translating their wishes into action; TEDx, which supports individuals or groups in hosting local, self- organized TED-style events around the world, and the TED Fellows program, helping world-changing innovators from around the globe to amplify the impact of their remarkable projects and activities.
